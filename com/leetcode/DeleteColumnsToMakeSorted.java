        *   You are given an array of n strings strs, all of the same length.

            The strings can be arranged such that there is one on each line, making a grid.

            For example, strs = ["abc", "bce", "cae"] can be arranged as follows:
            abc
            bce
            cae
            You want to delete the columns that are not sorted lexicographically. In the above example (0-indexed), columns 0 ('a', 'b', 'c') and 2 ('c', 'e', 'e') are sorted, while column 1 ('b', 'c', 'a') is not, so you would delete column 1.

            Return the number of columns that you will delete.
